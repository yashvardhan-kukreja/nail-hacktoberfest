</p>

Hacktoberfest 2020 has begun. And well, we all want T-shirts and stickers all the way from Github. But well, this time let's "actually" make some kickass PRs, learn truly about the titbits of open source dev.<br>
And this project is gonna make you do that.<br>
This project involves guides and fully explained and exemplified steps to contribute to this (or essentially any other) open source repository **the right way**

Let me say two things:

- It's incredibly easier than it looks.
- Once you get even 1 single PR merged in this repository, you would already be versed with some nice open source practices.

Now, jump to the next section to know about this project and realise how easy it is (and even to contribute to it).

If you like this idea and project, then do :star2: this repo. Will make me really happy :P

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Now, coming to this project and its functionality.
This is an extremely simple CLI (command-line-interface) which will give you random fun facts related to computer science, programming or whatever. <br>
The facts are contained within the code itself (here lies your contributions' opportunities ;) ) , hence, you don't need internet access to get those facts.

Later on, we can look forward to adding any other add-ons like jokes, quotes, and what not.

The idea is to bring you to the open source community and make you contribute to it and learn lots and lots.
